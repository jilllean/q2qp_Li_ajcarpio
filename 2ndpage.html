            <h2>Initiatives</h2>
            <p><span>Sustainable Landscape Approach</span>
                - The sustainable landscape approach, advocated by the Forest Foundation, redefines land-use planning by emphasizing integration and holistic perspectives. It views landscapes as jurisdictional planning areas, incorporating essential natural capital and production systems. Balancing production and conservation goals, this approach seeks a feasible implementation scale.

                Recognizing the vital role of landscapes in people's livelihoods, food, culture, and identity, the approach treats a forest landscape as a network of interdependent natural and human systems. Particularly valuable in landscapes with diverse stakeholders, it assumes the possibility of combining development, conservation, and human well-being. Long-term collaboration is essential for building consensus on land management policies and sustainable objectives.

                To maintain essential natural capital, the sustainable landscape approach promotes best practices in production, planning, and local decision-making. By integrating ecosystems into large-scale land-use strategies, countries can achieve sustainable agricultural and forest production, conserve natural capital, and enhance human well-being, addressing the complex challenge of climate change. </p>

                <h2>Involvements</h2>
                <p><span>We Work with Communities</span>
                - We catalyze local and national action towards improving our forests.

                PTFCF primarily works with civil society organizations, government agencies, local government units, members of the academe and scientific community, the private sector and most especially community members. We believe that community involvement is not only ethical but more importantly a key factor for success.

                PTFCF has worked with over 250 non-government organizations, people's organizations, academic institutions and individuals since 2005.<p>

                <h2>Activities and Participations</h2>
                <img class="projpic" src="images/projpic.jpg">
                <p>Forest Foundation Philippines primarily provides grants to support projects in the country's most critical forest landscapes: Sierra Madre, Palawan, Samar and Leyte, and Mindanao. However, the Foundation also supports projects at the National level, covering the conservation of small islands, mangroves, critical habitats, and urban forests.</p>
