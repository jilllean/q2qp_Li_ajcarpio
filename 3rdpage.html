            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are Forest Foundation Philippinesâ€”a non-profit organization providing grants and technical assistance to individuals and organizations that protect and conserve the forests.

            Bonded by a mutual affinity for the protection of the country's lush forests, Forest Foundation Philippines was established in 2002, under two bilateral agreements, between the governments of the United States of America and the Philippines, through the US Tropical Forest Conservation Act, which resulted in two Tropical Forest Conservation Agreements (TFCA1 and TFCA2). Under this, a 'debt-for-nature' agreement converts the Philippines' debt into funds that are used by the Foundation for forest protection and conservation activities.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Lush forests protected and conserved by empowered people.<p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To support activities that foster forest protection and conservation.</p>
            
            <h1>How to Help or Participate</h1>
            <h2>Tree-growing Projects</h2>
            <p> The Foundation offers support to individuals, companies, and other members of the private sector in their efforts to help protect and conserve the environment through tree-growing projects.

            <h2>Media Partnerships</h2>
            <p> 
                We would love to signal boost forest-related events and products, and amplify conservation messages in the broadcast and digital spaces. You may email us at info@forestfoundation.ph.</p>
